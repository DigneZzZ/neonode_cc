# Hello everyone!

It’s time to share the development plans for the project.

## Regarding the Openode.xyz project
- It will definitely continue to exist.
- Articles in clubs will continue to be updated as before.
- Information from the blog will also be duplicated on the forum.

## The NeoNode.cc Project
- This is my second project.
- Support for additional languages will be added to the articles.
- There will be no paid sections, but there’s one catch...
    - Some articles will only have previews.
    - The main content will be published in a Telegram bot with separate subscriptions for each section of the articles.
- There will be more free articles.
- The project aims to expand the audience and attract an international readership.

**The project has its own Telegram channel: [https://t.me/neonode_cc](https://t.me/neonode_cc)**  
**The project has its own Telegram community: [https://t.me/+cFdHT8DiMUA2MWVi](https://t.me/+cFdHT8DiMUA2MWVi)**

- I will be sharing all my key useful scripts and insights on this project.

## The Telegram Bot for Selling Articles
I’ve received multiple requests where people expressed they weren’t ready to buy access to all articles at once and would prefer to purchase access only to specific content they’re interested in.  
I decided to meet this demand, and I’ve already completed 30% of a bot that will allow users to buy access.  
- The bot will be multilingual (Russian and English).
- Cryptocurrency payments will be supported.
- Payments will also be available via Russian bank cards.

## The Marzban SaaS Project
This project is still in the MVP stage, and we are actively preparing for the production launch.  
A few key elements remain to be finalized, and once that's done, everything will be published.  
I will post an update about this on the blog.  
A special section for these tasks is already prepared: [https://neonode.cc/projects/msaas](https://neonode.cc/projects/msaas)

That’s all for now. Stay tuned for updates!
